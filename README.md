# :hamburger: EAT-DA-BURGER - Sequelize :hamburger:

### Overview
***

This is a full stack application that allows you to order a burger from the menu at EAT-DA-BURGER. 

Whenever a user submits an order, the application will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. 

After you devour the burger, a history will be created of the burger being devoured. This burger will then move over to the right side of the page indicating who devoured it and what they devoured.  

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
